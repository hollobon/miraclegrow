# Animated 3D Growing Plant in OpenGL

This was my solution to the University of York Computer Science Computer Graphics and
Visualisation coursework assessment in 2000, for graduation in 2000.

Purely for historical interest; I'm sure things have moved on a lot.

The animation runs way too fast; it was written on a 133Mhz Pentium, if memory serves correctly.
